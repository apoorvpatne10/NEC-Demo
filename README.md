# Visual Lip Reading NEC-Demo

The repository contains a small subset of GRID CORPUS to see how code for preprocessing, training and prediction works. Just for demonstration purposes.

## Dataset Preprocessing
Run mouth_extract.py in the MouthExtract directory. The code loads videos from the Video folder and saves each video as 75 mouth-crop frames.

## Network Training
Run train.py in the Training directory. The code loads training data which is preprocessed.

## Prediction
Run GUI.py in the PredictGUI directory.
